# Sonar-Mine-vs-Rock-prediction

The focus of this project will be the Sonar Mines vs Rocks dataset. The problem is to predict mine or rock objects from sonar return data. Each pattern is a set of 60 numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0. Each number represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time. The label associated with each record contains the letter R if the object is a rock and M if it is a mine (metal cylinder). The numbers in the labels are in increasing order of aspect angle, but they do not encode the angle directly.

This dataset was used in Gorman, R. P., and Sejnowski, T. J. (1988). “Analysis of Hidden Units in a Layered Network Trained to Classify Sonar Targets” in Neural Networks, Vol. 1, pp. 75–89.
